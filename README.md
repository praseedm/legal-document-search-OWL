# Legal Document Management System
Managing legal documents is a complex process that involves organizing, storing, and retrieving large volumes of data. 
A legal document management system (LDMS) can help law firms and legal departments manage these tasks more efficiently. 
Semantic web technologies provide a powerful framework for building LDMS that can streamline document management and retrieval.

In an LDMS that uses semantic web technologies, legal documents are stored as machine-readable data that can be searched, queried, and analyzed using advanced semantic search techniques.
This makes it possible to quickly locate relevant documents and extract specific data points, such as key terms, parties involved, and dates.

Ontology refers to a formal, machine-readable representation of knowledge that captures the concepts and relationships in a particular domain. 
Ontologies provide a common vocabulary and structure for describing and organizing data, making it easier to search, analyze, and share information.

***Designed Ontology for Legal Documents and Designed a Search interface using Django***
